Angular JS					Angular 2 and later
----------------					--------------------------
Released by Google in the year 2010.			Released in Sept 2016.

JavaScript-based framework for creating SPA.		Complete re-write of AngularJS version by Typescript.

Still supported but no longer will be developed.		It's updated version regularly released because of Semantic Versioning.

The architecture of AngularJS is based on MVC.		The architecture of Angular 2 is based on service/controller.

AngularJS was not developed with a mobile base in mind.	Angular 2 is a mobile-oriented framework.

AngularJS code can write by using only ES5, ES6, and Dart.	We can use ES5, ES6, Typescript to write an Angular 2 code.

Based on controllers whose scope is now over.		Nowadays, the controllers are replaced by components, 
						and Angular 2-8 is completely component based.

Factory, service, provider, value and constant are used 	The class is the only way to define services in Angular2
for services	

Run on only client-side				Runs on client-side & server-side

ng-app and angular bootstrap function are used to initialize	bootstrapmodule() function is used to initialize



















5.Angular Features:
=================
1.Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers, instead it uses components.
2.Angular has a different expression syntax for Data Binding:
		I.One Way Data Binding:

			1.Interpolation		{{}}
			2.Property Binding		[]
			3.Event Binding		()

		II.Two Way Data Binding:	[	()	]

3.Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules
4.Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following features:
	Class-based Object Oriented Programming
	Static Typing	(DataTypes:	number,string,boolean,array,enum)
	Generics		(any)
	TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6, and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript). 
		
	javascript		=	ECMAScript 1 to 5

	typescript	=	ECMAScript 1 to 5	(javascript)	+ 	ECMAScript 6




6.Angular Version Naming Conventions:
=================================
	Every 6 months angular is updated

Ex:

	Angular 7.2.0

	7	->Version Change
	2	->Minor Changes in Current Version
	0	->Patch Change










7.Software Setup:
================
1.Git 	(download & install)

	Verify:	git	--version

2.Node Js		=>	To run typescript programs we need server & client environment

	Download Node Js from 	https://nodejs.org/	& install it

	Verify:	node	--version		{10.15.0}

3.npm tool	=>	It used to install extra packages to Node Js like typescript,angular cli,bootstrap,....

	Ex1:	npm 	install 	-g 	typescript

	Verify:	npm	--version		{6.4.1}

4.Install Angular CLI(Common Language Interpreter

You use the Angular CLI to 

	1.Create projects,
	2.Generate applications
	3.Library code
	4. Perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.
	5.Auto Intelligence
	
Installation:
---------------
	npm 	install 	-g 	@angular/cli			{1st time}

	OR

	npm 	install 	-g 	@angular/cli@latest		{Update}

	Verify:	ng	--version

4.Visual Studio Code:

	IDE for preparing  angular applications


8.First application:(Without IDE)
=============================

step1: create a folder & open cmd prompt in current folder	(other than c: drive)
step2:creating angular project
	syntax:
		ng	new	<applicationame>

step3:choose 	1.css type 	2.routing required or not

step4:enter into ur project folder
	syntax:
		cd	<applicationame>

step5:run the empty project
	command:
		
		ng	serve	-o
		Or
		npm	start
